<h3>Tiger</h3>
<p>The hind legs of the tiger are longer than their front legs. This characteristic enables them to leap forward distances up to 10 meters (32.5 ft).

The bones of the tiger's front legs are strong and dense to support the large musculature needed to take down large prey.

The bones in each of the tiger's feet are tightly connected by ligaments enabling them to buffer the impact of landing from running, pouncing and leaping.

Tigers have large padded feet that enable them to silently stalk prey in the Asian jungles.

The claws of the tiger are up to 10 centimeters (4 in) in length and are used to grasp and hold onto prey. Each paw has four of these claws and one specialized claw called a dewclaw. A dewclaw is located farther back on the foot and thereby does not touch the ground when walking. Dewclaws function similarly 
to thumbs in that they are used for grasping prey and aid in climbing</p>
